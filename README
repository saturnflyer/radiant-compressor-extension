# Compressor

Compressor provides an option to strip all non space-character 
whitespace, and replace double spaces with single spaces in the 
Radiant ResponseCache.

Set `Radiant::Config['response_cache.compressed?'] = true` to take
advantage of Compressor.

## Tips

You'll need to use semi-colon line endings in any inline javascript,
and any `<pre>` elements will be reformatted, so if you'll have that
in your site, this extension is not for you.
